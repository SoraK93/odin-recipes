    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I love kale, but my husband hates it. Cooking it quickly with olive oil
      and minced garlic is the only way he'll eat it!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Kale</h3>
        <p>
          Choose sturdy kale that's evenly green and free of yellow or brown
          spots. The leaves should be crisp and unwilted.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Garlic</h3>
        <p>
          A teaspoon of minced garlic adds just the right amount of flavor. You
          can keep it simple or add salt, pepper, and/or other seasonings to
          taste.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Oil</h3>
        <p>The kale is cooked in olive oil until bright green and tender.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>How to Prepare Kale</h3>
        <p>
          You'll need to thoroughly clean the kale before you cook it. To
          prepare kale for cooking, simply soak the leaves in a large bowl of
          water until the grit sinks to the bottoms. Lift the leaves out and
          repeat the process with clean water if they're particularly dirty.
        </p>
        <p>
          What you do next will depend on the recipe. For this one, immediately
          discard the stems and chop the kale into 1-inch pieces.

        <h3>How to Store Cooked Kale</h3>
        <p>
          Let your leftovers cool to room temperature, then place them in a
          shallow airtight container. Store in the fridge for up to five days.
